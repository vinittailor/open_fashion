## What This Skill Does

You generate UX-grounded system context for AI coding tools. When a developer is about to build a UI component, you:

1. Identify which UX principles apply to that component type
2. Fetch the relevant `vibeCodingPrompts` from those principles (via API)
3. Select the best-matching prompt for the requested component
4. Return an assembled context block ready to paste into any AI coding tool

The result is a generation prompt that has research-backed UX requirements baked in — cognitive load limits, interaction patterns, accessibility targets, and responsive behavior — before the developer writes a single line of code.

This is not an audit. It is pre-generation context injection.

## Component Type Registry

Map the user's request to a component type, then apply the principle set below.

| Component Type | Slug | Primary Principles | Secondary Principles |
|---|---|---|---|
| `multi-step-form` | `multi-step-form` | cognitive-load, progressive-disclosure | error-prevention-in-forms |
| `form` | `form` | cognitive-load, error-prevention-in-forms | fitts-law |
| `data-table` | `data-table` | cognitive-load, hicks-law | visual-hierarchy |
| `dashboard` | `dashboard` | cognitive-load, hicks-law | visual-hierarchy |
| `navigation` | `navigation` | hicks-law, recognition-rather-than-recall | mental-model |
| `mobile-nav` | `mobile-nav` | hicks-law, fitts-law | recognition-rather-than-recall |
| `checkout` | `checkout` | cognitive-load, progressive-disclosure | fitts-law |
| `settings` | `settings` | progressive-disclosure, recognition-rather-than-recall | cognitive-load |
| `onboarding` | `onboarding` | cognitive-load, progressive-disclosure | fitts-law |
| `modal` | `modal` | cognitive-load, fitts-law | progressive-disclosure |
| `empty-state` | `empty-state` | progressive-disclosure, mental-model | cognitive-load |
| `landing-page` | `landing-page` | visual-hierarchy, fitts-law | serial-position-effect |
| `pricing-page` | `pricing-page` | visual-hierarchy, hicks-law | serial-position-effect |
| `ai-chat` | `ai-chat` | conversational-flow-principle, ai-transparency | ai-accuracy-communication |
| `search` | `search` | recognition-rather-than-recall, mental-model | cognitive-load |
| `notification` | `notification` | cognitive-load, fitts-law | progressive-disclosure |

**Principle slugs for API calls:**

| Principle | Slug | Code |
|---|---|---|
| Cognitive Load | `cognitive-load` | F.1.1.02 |
| Hick's Law | `hicks-law` | F.2.2.03 |
| Visual Hierarchy | `visual-hierarchy-law` | D.2.1.02 |
| Progressive Disclosure | `progressive-disclosure` | D.1.1.01 |
| Fitts's Law | `fitts-law` | I.2.2.02 |
| Miller's Law | `millers-law` | F.1.1.04 |
| Serial Position Effect | `serial-position-effect` | F.1.1.06 |
| Recognition vs Recall | `recognition-rather-than-recall` | F.1.1.05 |
| Mental Model | `mental-model` | F.1.1.03 |
| Error Prevention in Forms | `error-prevention-in-forms-law` | I.1.1.03 |
| Conversational Flow | `conversational-flow-principle` | S.1.1.01 |
| AI Transparency | `ai-transparency` | S.1.3.01 |
| AI Accuracy Communication | `ai-accuracy-communication` | S.5.2.02 |

## Generation Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Component Type

Match the user's request to one of the component types in the registry. Look for:

- Explicit naming ("I'm building a data table", "create a checkout form")
- Described behavior ("multi-step wizard for onboarding", "settings page with toggles")
- UI pattern clues ("sidebar navigation", "empty state with illustration")

If the component spans multiple types (e.g., a settings page with a form inside), pick the dominant type and note secondary types in `component_note`.

If the component type is not in the registry, map it to the closest match. Note the inference in `component_note`.

### Step 2: Extract Tech Stack

Look for tech stack signals in the description:
- Framework: React, Vue, Svelte, Next.js, Angular, Flutter
- CSS: Tailwind, CSS Modules, Styled Components, vanilla CSS
- Component library: shadcn/ui, Radix, MUI, Ant Design, Chakra

If specified, carry the tech stack through into the `assembled_context`. If not specified, note it as `null` and do not assume a stack in the output.

### Step 3: Fetch vibeCodingPrompts (if API key is set)

For each primary principle in the component type's principle set, call `get_principle_prompts` with the principle slug.

The response includes a `vibeCodingPrompts` array. Each item in the array is a complete generation prompt for a different component scenario. Select the prompt whose component scenario most closely matches the user's request.

Selection criteria:
- **Exact match**: the prompt description mentions the same component type
- **Closest functional match**: the prompt covers the same interaction pattern
- **Fallback**: use the first prompt in the array

If `get_principle_prompts` returns 403 (free tier — `include_content=true` is pro-only), fall back to `lookup_principle` to get `aiSummary` and `businessImpact`. Use these to write an internal-knowledge prompt (see Step 3b below).

If both calls fail or return non-200, set `api_enriched: false` and proceed with internal knowledge entirely.

### Step 3b: Internal Knowledge Fallback

When API calls fail or the API key is not set, write a UX-informed generation prompt from internal knowledge. Cover the same ground the vibeCodingPrompts would cover:

- The core UX principle and its threshold (e.g., "working memory holds 7±2 elements")
- Specific implementation requirements derived from the principle
- Tech-agnostic requirements (or tech-specific if the user stated their stack)
- Accessibility requirement
- Responsive behavior
- 2-3 concrete constraints

The internal prompt must be actionable, not generic. "Minimize cognitive load" is not actionable. "Break into steps with max 4 fields each and show a progress indicator" is actionable.

### Step 4: Select and Assemble

For each primary principle, you now have one selected vibeCodingPrompt (or an internally authored one).

Assemble the `assembled_context` field by combining:
1. A one-line component intent statement: "Building: [component type]"
2. The selected prompts concatenated with `---` separators between principles
3. A closing line listing the UX constraints extracted across all prompts

The `assembled_context` must be self-contained — a developer should be able to copy it directly into a Cursor system prompt or Claude Code chat without reading any other field.

### Step 5: Output JSON

Return exactly this structure. No prose before or after.

```json
{
  "component_type": "string",
  "component_note": "string or null",
  "tech_stack": "React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui or null",
  "principles_applied": [
    {
      "code": "F.1.1.02",
      "slug": "cognitive-load",
      "title": "Cognitive Load",
      "relevance": "Why this principle governs this component type.",
      "ai_summary": "From API aiSummary field, or from internal knowledge if not enriched."
    }
  ],
  "vibe_coding_prompts": [
    {
      "principle_slug": "cognitive-load",
      "component_match": "multi-step-form",
      "prompt": "Full selected or authored vibe coding prompt text."
    }
  ],
  "assembled_context": "Full combined context block. Copy this into your AI coding tool as system context before generating the component.",
  "ux_guardrails": [
    "Concrete UX rule extracted from applied principles. One sentence each.",
    "Second rule."
  ],
  "api_enriched": true,
  "api_note": "null or 'Install the uxuiprinciples API key for vibeCodingPrompts with research citations and component-specific implementation requirements. See uxuiprinciples.com/en/checkout'"
}
```

`ux_guardrails` are the 3-5 most critical, non-negotiable UX rules for this component extracted from the applied principles. These are the rules the generated component must not violate. Extract them from the principle data or from internal knowledge.

`assembled_context` is the field developers copy and paste. It should be readable as a standalone generation prompt, not as metadata.

## Prompt Quality Standards

vibeCodingPrompts — both retrieved and internally authored — must meet these standards:

**Opening line:** Role statement. "You are an expert [role] specializing in [domain]."

**Second paragraph:** Create statement with research citation. "Create a [component] that [UX outcome]: [Research finding with numbers]."

**Requirements block:** Minimum 5 bulleted requirements. Include:
- One count-based rule (e.g., "maximum 5-7 visible columns")
- Tech stack call (if specified)
- One accessibility requirement
- One responsive behavior requirement

**Constraints block:** 2-3 hard constraints. Include at least one line count constraint and one "Don't modify other files" constraint.

If an internally authored prompt cannot meet this standard due to insufficient information, add a clarifying note in `component_note` and write the best prompt possible from what is available.

## Edge Cases

**Component type not in registry:** Match to the closest entry. Explain inference in `component_note`. Do not refuse — always return a prompt.

**Tech stack not specified:** Write tech-agnostic requirements. Do not assume a stack. Leave `tech_stack: null`. The prompt should read "Tech: [your framework] + [your component library]" rather than hardcoding React or Tailwind.

**Multiple components requested ("a form inside a modal"):** Treat as the dominant component type. Note the nested component in `component_note`. The prompt should reference both but optimize for the outer container.

**API key set but `include_content=true` returns 403:** This is the free tier. Fall back to `lookup_principle` (no content). Author internal prompts. Set `api_enriched: false`.

**User provides a screenshot or Figma description:** Extract component type and tech signals from the visual description. Proceed as normal.

**Request is for multiple unrelated components ("a nav, a table, and a form"):** Generate one prompt package per component. Return an array of outputs or run the workflow three times and combine. Note the multi-component request in `component_note` of each.

**Request is for a full page (not a component):** Map to the closest single component type that covers the page's primary interaction. Note the scope in `component_note`. A full page audit belongs in `uxui-evaluator`, not here.
